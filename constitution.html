   <h2 id="historyhindu"> Preamble to the Constitution of Bharat </h2>
   <div class="odishapara1">
     <p> The Preamble to the Constitution is not merely a piece of text. These are the sentences that string together every Indian, showing us that even with our differences, we’re all part of the same nation, and moving towards a collective goal to awaken, strengthen and build Bharat, as Bharat Maa does its duty of protecting our rights. </p>
        <p>It was adopted on 26 November 1949 by the Constituent Assembly and came into effect on 26 January 1950, celebrated as the Republic day in India.
     </p>

     <br></br>
     <p>
        The preamble-page, along with other pages of the original Constitution of India, was designed and decorated by the renowned painter Beohar Rammanohar Sinha of Jabalpur who was at Shantiniketan with Acharya Nandalal Bose at that time. Nandalal Bose endorsed Beohar Rammanohar Sinha's artwork without any alteration whatsoever. As such, the page bears Beohar Rammanohar Sinha's short signature Ram in Devanagari lower-right corner. The calligraphy was done by Prem Behari Narain Raizada.

       <h4><b>Sovereign</b></h4>
     <p>Sovereign means the independent authority of a State. It means, that it has the power to legislate on any subject; and that it is not subject to the control of any other State / external power.

        According to the preamble, the constitution of India has been pursuance of the solemn resolution of the people of India to constitute India into a ‘Sovereign Democratic Republic’, and to secure well-defined objects set forth in the preamble. Sovereignty denotes supreme and ultimate power. It may be real or normal, legal or political, individual or pluralistic. </p>
        <h4><b>Socialist</b></h4>
        <p> The term socialist refers to democratic socialism, i.e. achievement of socialist goals through democratic, evolutionary and non-violent means. Essentially, it means that (since wealth is generated socially) wealth should be shared equally by society through distributive justice, not concentrated in the hands of few, and that the government should regulate the ownership of land and industry to reduce socio-economic inequalities.</p>
        <h4><b>Secular</b></h4>
        <p>Secular means that the relationship between the government and religious groups are determined according to constitution and law. It separates the power of the state and religion.</p>
        <h4><b>Democratic</b></h4>
        <p>The people of India elect their governments by a system of universal adult franchise, popularly known as "one person one vote". This representative form of government is suitable for governing the country because of its huge and diverse population. Every citizen of India 18 years of age or older and not otherwise debarred by law is entitled to vote.</p>
        <h4><b>Republic</b></h4>
        <p>In a republican form of government, the head of state is elected and not a hereditary monarch. Thus, this word denotes a government where no one holds public power as a proprietary right. As opposed to a monarchy, in which the head of state is appointed on a hereditary basis for life or until abdication, a democratic republic is an entity in which the head of state is elected, directly or indirectly, for a fixed tenure. Thus, India has a president who is indirectly elected and has a fixed term of office. There's an absence of a privileged class and all public offices are open to every citizen without discrimination.</p>
