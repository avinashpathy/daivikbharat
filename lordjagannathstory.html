   <h2 id="historyhindu"> Story of Lord Jagannath </h2>
   <div class="odishapara1">
     <p> Once upon a time, there was a king named <b>Indradyumna</b> of Avanti who was a great devotee of Lord Vishnu. He had an ardent desire to see Lord Vishnu. One day, the king was informed that Lord Vishnu is worshipped in His truest form as <b>Neela Madhava</b> in Odisha. Hearing this, the king then immediately ordered the head priest <b>Vidyapati</b> to head to Odisha in search of Lord Neela Madhava. </p>
        <p>After a long tiring journey Vidyapati reached Odisha. There he found the tribal chieftain <b>Vishvavasu</b> who was secretly guarding Lord Neela Madhava. He pleaded Vishvavasu to show him the place of worship but the tribal chieftain refused. Vidyapati continued to stay in the village. Eventually, he fell in love with Vishvavasu’s daughter Lalitha and married her after some time. Soon after the wedding, Vidyapati asked his wife to convince his father-in-law for just one glimpse of Lord Neela Madhava.

     </p>

    <br></br>
     <p>
        On his daughter’s insistence, Vishvavasu, the tribal chieftain, finally agreed but on one condition i.e. Vidyapati will be taken blindfoldedly. Vidyapati took with him seeds of mustard which he dropped on the way so as to remember the route to the cave. Upon reaching the secret cave, once the blindfold was removed Vidyapati was spellbound to see the most magnificent image of Lord Neela Madhava. Vidyapati informed the king so he came to the place but, to his disappointment, the deity disappeared. In order to see the deity, he observed fast unto death on Mount Neela. Once he heard a voice saying that he will see the deity so he sacrificed a horse and built a temple and Narada installed the idol of Sri Narsimha in the temple.After a while, King Indradyumna became frustrated with not seeing Neela Madhava. He decided to lie on a bed of Kusa grass and fast until death.

     
     </p>
     <p> <b>Lord Jagannath</b> came to him in a dream and told him I shall come floating from the sea in my wooden form as<b> Daru-brahman</b> at the place called Bakimuhan.The King went to this place and saw a huge piece of wood which had the marks of a conch, club, disc, and lotus on it. Many men and elephants tried to move Daru-brahman, but they could not move Him. That night Lord Jagannatha spoke to Indradyumna in a dream and told him to bring Visvavasu, who used to serve Nila Madhava and bring a golden chariot in front of Daru-brahman. The king did this and Daru-brahman easily was placed onto the chariot.

    </p>
        
        <p>King Indradyumna had the best sculptors come to carve the Deity of Lord Jagannath from Daru-brahman. As soon as they started their chisels broke to pieces. The Supreme Lord Himself came in Disguise as an old artist who called Himself <b>Ananta Maharana</b> (According to the Narada Purana, <b>Visvakarma</b>, the artisans of Gods).He said that if he was able to work behind closed doors for 21 days then the deities could be carved. The old sculptor then took Daru-brahman into the temple and the doors were closed. After 14 days passed, the king could not hear any sounds of the artist’s tools and he became fully anxious. The king then personally opened the door of the temple by force. 
        </p>
        <p>The King was not able to see Vishwakarma, but instead, he saw the three forms of <b>Lord Jagannath, Maa Subhadra, and Lord Balabhadra</b>. Their fingers and toes were unfinished. Thinking himself to be a great offender, the king decided to give up his life. He then lay on a bed of Kusa grass and began to fast. Lord Jagannath appeared to him in a dream. He told the king that He is eternally situated here in Nilachala in the form of Lord Jagannath as Daru-brahman. In the material world, I descended in 24 Deity incarnations along with my abode. I have no material hands and feet, but with my transcendental senses, I accept all the items offered by My devotees.
        </p>
        <p>It is believed that the same form of the iconic wooden idols is housed in the famous Jagannath temple in Puri, Odisha.</p>
